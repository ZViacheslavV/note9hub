## 📝 [NoteHub (web application)](https://09-auth-rho-six.vercel.app)

> A secure, modern application for creating, organizing, and browsing personal notes with full authentication support.

NoteHub focuses on clean architecture, reliable data flow, and a smooth user experience built on top of a robust TypeScript + Next.js foundation.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **TypeScript** – static safety, predictable logic
- **Next.js** / React – components, routing, SSR/CSR, advanced patterns
- **REST API** – structured data exchange
- **Vite** – fast local development
- **Git** – version control

## 🎼 Key Features
- **Full-stack–ready foundation built** on Next.js 15 with server components, optimized routing, and modern app directory patterns.
- **Strict TypeScript architecture** ensuring type-safety across components, hooks, API layers, and forms.
- **Secure authentication system** with cookie-based session handling and protected routes.
- **Advanced state management** via Zustand for predictable, scalable, framework-agnostic state.
- **Optimized data fetching** using React Query with caching, background updates, and request deduplication.
- **Responsive and accessible UI** with reusable components and clean separation of concerns.
- **Robust form management** powered by Formik + Yup for validation schemas.
- **High scalability** thanks to consistent coding standards (ESLint + Prettier), modular structure, and Route Interceptions/Parallel Routes capabilities.
- **Fast development workflow** supported by TypeScript, ESLint, Prettier, and hot reloading.
  
## 💥 Implemented Functionality
- **Built secure user authentication** (login, session handling, route protection) with cookie-based workflows and structured API handlers.
- **Implemented full CRUD interaction flow** for creating, viewing, and browsing personal notes.
- **Integrated React Query** to manage asynchronous operations with caching, refetch logic, error boundaries, and stale-while-revalidate behavior.
- **Added pagination** using react-paginate; optimized page transitions, edge cases, and state synchronization.
- **Implemented search & filtering with debounced input** (use-debounce) for improved performance and UX.
- **Created reusable UI components** and personal React hooks following Next.js + React best practices.
- **Added form handling logic** with Formik and Yup validation schemas (error states, async validation, submit flows).
- **Ensured consistent, maintainable codebase** via ESLint (Next config), Prettier, TS strict mode, and folder-level conventions.
- **Designed modular API layer** using Axios instances with interceptors for automated error handling and request normalization.
- **Improved client-side performance** through memoization, controlled re-renders, and route-level optimizations.
